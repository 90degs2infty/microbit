microbit
========

_microbit_ contains everything required to get started with the use of Rust to create firmwares for the fabulous [BBC micro:bit][] microcontroller board. This little board has everything and a kitchen sink built-in, even a capable debugging interface, so all that one needs to get going with programming this device is:

* A BBC micro:bit board
* A computer (macOS and Linux work perfectly, [Windows tested as well](http://flames-of-code.netlify.com/blog/rust-microbit-windows/))
* A bit of open source software

Some very preliminary examples of using this crate can be found [here in this repo][examples] or [here on my blog][myblog].

A guide to embedded development with Rust on the _microbit_ using this crate can be found in the [MicroRust book][microrust].
