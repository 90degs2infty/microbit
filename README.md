microbit
========

_microbit_ contains everything required to get started with the use of Rust to create firmwares for the 
faboulus [BBC micro:bit][] microcontroller board. This little board
contains has everything and a kitchensink built-in, even a capable debugging
interface, so all that one needs to get going with progamming this device is:

* A BBC micro:bit board
* A computer (macOS and Linux work perfectly, [Windows tested as well](http://flames-of-code.netlify.com/blog/rust-microbit-windows/))
* A bit of open source software

Some very preliminary examples of using this crate can be found [here](https://www.eggers-club.de/blog/2018/05/31/rust-on-the-microbit-101-part-1)  
More information about how to use this coming soon...
